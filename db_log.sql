Now for my reasoning. \r\n\r\nI have a really freaking wide display for my main monitor, so big that it distorts badly formatted webpages. Such as my own(although i have to admit it\'s looking spiffier every day ;) ) This is actually a tv i\'m using so it\'s pretty huge. \r\n\r\nI know i\'m not alone in the giant display-ness. Anyway long story short having div set at a % width messes with things way to much from one display to the next. Setting things at 900 which is a fad at the moment. Tends to make things look a lot nicer from display to display.

Probably not this friday.'),(18,'Start of the Second Week of School','February 3, 2014','This semester i\'m taking Physics, a writing intensive, environmental science and Government.\r\n\r\nGiven my knowledge on politics is pretty basic, i always assumed things followed the three musketeers. Democrats dig a one for all approach expecting the rich to spread their wealth around, where as the republicans want an all for one approach. Working towards obtaining everything they can for their own pocket book, fuck everyone else.\r\n\r\nLibertarians(becoming more relevant) are more like the king, \"I don\'t care, just leave me alone. Do these clothes look good on me?\"\r\n\r\nAnd the Green Party would probably be Dartanian just because they deserve a mention. Trying to get everyone to get along. There\'s a bit more to them but they don\'t get a lot of airtime so i\'m really not sure about them.\r\n\r\nI did simplify things i realize that isn\'t perfect and each group is slightly disjointed with members entertaining different political views from one another, but i don\'t have a perfect working knowledge of each political group and i\'m not going to pretend to. This class should help bring me up to speed though. At the very least i should pick something up out of the New York Times reading. \r\n\r\nAs for the Environmental Science Class, it should be a lot of book work learning about forests and stuff. My main concern is an environmental project. I have absolutely no idea what i\'m going to do, not sure i can get away with fishing once a week but if that doesn\'t pan out i\'ll go vegetarian or something. I\'d be happy to do something larger scale for the good of the environment but honestly i\'m just concerned with my physics class. \r\n\r\nPhysics doesn\'t seem to bad yet, but i\'m not optimistic enough to believe things will be easy. Right now we\'re on static electricity and how the formula seems to closely mirror that of gravitational pull. I\'ll actually be working on this the majority of my day so hopefully i\'ll have a much better idea soon. \r\n\r\nAs for the website, I did some work on the dj section when i couldn\'t sleep last night, you can view my \"planned\" playlists on there, which will switch up as i need them to. Paint it black and Johnny Swim are definitely going to be there though. Remember you can listen to me live at 1pm on <a href=\"http://kssu.com\">KSSU</a> I don\'t play any hiphop but i do play... just about everything else, mainly stick to 80\'s/90\'s rock but i never stay there the whole show.

Missing a magic Tournament and i\'m assuming everybody hates me for not making it :/ But i\'m teh sick, so you think they\'d get that? Like people are dying right now, from being sick. Being sick like i am, but hopefully theirs is worse. Cause i don\'t wanna die. Not overly worried about it though, i\'ve been sicker.\r\n\r\nOh yeah i\'m a vegetarian now! or umm, i guess \"Pescatarian\" but most of my meals are vegetarian anyway, except mayo kinda caught me off guard.

But i\'m hoping this is another excuse to spend more time on campus which would force me to work on h/w more. which is win win, this colelge stuff ain\'t easy and i really really don\'t want to take physics again.

I\'ve managed to stick to new things so i don\'t get tired of it, and i still have a lot of options left but i can\'t help but REALLY want a burger.. or fries, god that\'d be amazing.

It\'s a tall order and i can\'t afford to fall behind again. I figured out how many hours i spend on school a week and it\'s right around 60 hrs.. Which is a bit much. Plus i joined the ACM to help out with their website stuff so it\'ll be going up.

Alright it doesn\'t seem like a big deal but it does make me happy. There\'s a whole layer to this website that you guys can\'t see and one of them is an alternative view for my playlists that makes copying and pasting to <a href=\"http://facebook.com/djgooddeal\">facebook</a> a lot easier.

Upside PR people say that people like activity on a website. Downside the server I use is pretty cheap so a lot of traffic could be bad for my uses. I did make this website as lightweight as possible so it could load efficiently even under heavy traffic having only 2 pictures on the webpage, and one is only 1 pixel wide(the background).

The level of studying involved was an insane level difference from highschool.. now i\'m at Sac state and I don\'t think the material is meant to be harder but I feel like i\'m stretched thinner then ever before, as time goes by I just wish it would stop just for a second. I get that is a ridiculous statement but I need a break from clocks, I need to enjoy a moment here and there, it feels like i\'m running from one thing to the next without enjoying a moment of it.

Which is sad to some degree, but i\'m tired of having so much crap that doesn\'t do anything. You know you receive something and you feel like you\'re supposed to hold on to it, and after awhile it just feels like you\'re holding on to junk for no reason. Going to get rid of some old sentimental things too that are more decorative.  \r\n\r\nPlan on doing a few things to the website, and building some Arduino stuff as well :) Should be cool.

Like I know everything is going to be alright, and i\'m just staying on top of things.\r\n\r\nIn many years past I would kind of meltdown and pull all nighters to make sure everything was turned in and fine, but as i get older I find that\'s just not necessary. Plus it makes everything in the subsequent days about a million times harder. I\'ve made sure I get a full 8 hours every night and my stress is down and nothing seems like it\'s outside my ability. Everything seems like I can handle it and I just feel good about it.\r\n\r\nAnyway; I\'m taking AI(Intelligent Systems), Data Mining, Calculus 3, Senior Project, and Senior Seminar. Most are pretty self explanatory, Senior Seminar is going to be a bunch of seminars that my classes will not normally cover. So it should be pretty neat. Just have to do some papers on them, and although my grammar isn\'t top notch, writing comes to me pretty easily. \r\n\r\nI\'ve thought about what I want to do when everything is over with, I\'d love to move into AI or data mining, but I think i\'d be pretty happy with any form of software development. Maybe i\'ll continue to blog on the side, or create one of those comic websites. No matter what I do I\'m really looking forward to it.

As well as applying for some internships. I kind of wish I could see it as a break, but It looks like I have plans for St Patrick\'s day, and I\'ll probably take 1 or 2 days off during the break.

I also want to make more parts of this site dynamic, like Projects -> Portfolio and some of the links on the bottom of this page.

A little proud of that one, but there may be a better route for implementing it. Now my notes are separated by category which is auto-filled into a drop down menu. It\'s running a little slower then it could be but that was a time vs efficiency trade off. Oh yeah, I may also be moving over to a new domain soon. I feel like have a username as my url may be a little outdated. Perhaps I watched Hackers as a kid one too many times.\r\n\r\nAnyhoo if ChrisDiel.com is available when I switch i\'ll grab it, or i\'ll stay here otherwise. The truth is I don\'t get a lot of traffic, this website really only exists as a repository for web tools i\'ve created over the years. It would also make a decent portfolio If I reworked my projects section.

I plan on moving things over within the next couple of months and killing this domain off. \r\n\r\nMy future projects involve fixing my Projects Section so it will behave more like a dynamic portfolio, I don\'t want to have to deal with html and css every time I manage my content on there. I\'m also going to utilize github in the future so I can add links to my projects for people to follow. github seems huge and I really need to start taking advantage of that.
