# PHP-Portfolio-Website

I originally built this version of this website in my early years of college. It's sort of a portfolio/blog/any small application i felt like building. The idea was to practice web development and learn PHP and Mysql.

These days i mostly work with Microsoft SQL and i've been learning Python, as such i was thinking about building a new website from the ground up. This project was useful though especially if I ever plan to build another website on a LAMP stack so i thought i'd stash a copy on Github. Maybe this code will be useful for someone else out there.

I left some of the MYSQL in here, but i did leave some of the folder structure out as well as the important authentication string stuff. I wouldn't try to upload this and tinker with it but instead scavenge small tidbits of code that you need :) Some of this is a little outdated though.
