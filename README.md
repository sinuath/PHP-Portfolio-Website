# PHP-Portfolio-Website

This is the 4th or 5th iteration of my website. This is a PHP and MYSQL website that I used as a portfolio for some of my work while I was going through college. it was a good learning experience as i continued to learn different web development techniques. I generally rebuild my website from the ground up every 5 years or so and this website has been up for about 7-8 years so I think it's time to rebuild again. Think I'll do Python this time around(definitely not doing it in flash again lol).

Anyway I made sure I could manage this website from the front end since i didn't want to worry about working with HTML and PHP everytime i wanted to update some content, so it allows Creation/Reads/Updates/Delete from the front end. I think the only thing I couldn't do was upload images from the front end, I believe that came down to the security on the host I was using, so there wasn't much I could do about it.
