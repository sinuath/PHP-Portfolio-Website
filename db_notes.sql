Note:  Specific   instructions   for   programming   assignments ,   including   the    deliverable  requirements  and   due  dates,  will  be  assigned  in  separate  documents  after  corresponding   lectures.   So,   please   make   sure   you   get   this   important   information   in   class   or   via    SacCT /email .  Programming  exercises  will  be  graded  for   correctness (including  functionality  completeness  and   programming  clearness  in  terms  of  appearance,  programming  style   and  comments) ,  which  occupies  60%  points,   as  well  as  for robustness ,  which  earns  the  other  40%   points . All  output should be identified  and illustrated , and the input used for any program should  be listed and explained. Your programming assignments will be completed on a Linux  system (or  Windows  if  possible).  When  applicable,  input  should  be  read  from  a  file /console,  and  output   redirected  to  a  file/console,  so  that  the  inputs,  output s  and  program  listings  can  be  easily   printed /snapshoted .  \r\n\r\n\r\nA  â€œ clinician â€  will  be  associated  with   this  course,  to  help  you  with   improvements  regarding   robustness .  For each assignment, the students can have two submission opportunities: one to  catch  the  deadline  and  the  other  o ne  after  correction.  Only  students  who  visit  the  clinic  at   least once  per assignment  will be given  the opportunity to get lost points back.  Specifically,  the   second  submission  could  earn  back  80%  of  the  lost  points  in  the  first  one  due  to  non- robustness. H ence, students are strongly encouraged to see the clinicians for correction.  The  clinicians will hold regular office hours during which students can come and consult on a drop-in  basis.',0),(9,'Pandora','Javascript','A piece of javascript to be entered at the console so i can select the artist and the song from pandora.\r\n\r\nArtist and Song Name:\r\n\r\nconsole.log(\"Artist: \"+$(\'a.artistSummary\')[0].innerHTML+\"\\nSong: \"+$(\'a.songTitle\')[0].innerHTML);\r\n\r\nThis one won\'t explain which is the artist or song name, easier for copying and pasting.\r\n\r\nTo copy the text easily use:\r\nwindow.prompt(\"Copy to clipboard: Ctrl+C, Enter\", text);\r\n\r\nconsole.log($(\'a.artistSummary\')[0].innerHTML+\"\\n\"+$(\'a.songTitle\')[0].innerHTML);',0),(10,'Pickles','Recipe','Ingredients\r\n\r\n1/2 onion, thinly sliced\r\n2 medium cucumbers, thinly sliced\r\n1 cup water\r\n1 and 1/2 cup cider vinegar\r\n1/2 cup sugar\r\n2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons kosher salt\r\n1 teaspoon mustard seeds\r\n1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric\r\n1 teaspoon celery seeds\r\n1 teaspoon pickling spice\r\n4 whole garlic cloves, smashed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections\r\n\r\nCombine the onion and cucumber slices in a clean spring-top jar.\r\n\r\nCombine the remaining ingredients, with the exception of the garlic, in a non-reactive saucepan.
